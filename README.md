## Host
### Intel NUC (NUC7i3BNH)


I moved from a Raspberry Pi3 to an [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc7i3bnh.html), with 8GB of RAM, Gigabit Ethernet and a Samsung 850 Evo SSD.

System Load with HomeAssistant, various Docker Containers, autossh bridges and other services is moderate. All time laod average is below 0.6.


### VENV / Services
I am running HomeAssistant in a [virtual environment](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/).
The initial basic setup is documented [here](https://chris.0x711.de/index.php/2018/01/31/setting-up-home-assistant-in-a-virtual-environment-on-intel-nuc/).
